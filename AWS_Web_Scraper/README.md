# Cloud-Based Web Scraping and Data Aggregation

This project uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping and stores the data in a DynamoDB table on AWS. The scraper is designed to run on AWS Lambda.

## Setup

1. Set up an AWS account and create a DynamoDB table.
2. Set the following environment variable in your Lambda function:
   - `DYNAMODB_TABLE`: Your DynamoDB table's name.
3. Deploy the scraper to AWS Lambda.

## Usage

To start the scraper, invoke your Lambda function. The scraper will start and store the scraped data in your DynamoDB table.

Please note that you’ll need to replace 'http://example.com' with the URLs you want to scrape and implement your own parsing logic. You’ll also need to replace 'title' and 'content' with your actual column names. This is just a basic template to get you started. You might need to handle more complex scenarios depending on the websites you’re scraping and the data you’re dealing with. This project is suitable for a job application as it demonstrates knowledge of cloud services, databases, and web scraping.
