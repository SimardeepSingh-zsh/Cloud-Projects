# SecureCloudK8s

SecureCloudK8s is a robust, cloud-native application designed to run on Kubernetes. It leverages Docker for containerization, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

## Overview

SecureCloudK8s is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and highly available cloud-native environment. It uses Docker to package, distribute, and run applications across different environments. Jenkins is used for automating the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that the application is always in a releasable state. Terraform is used to provision and manage the cloud infrastructure on AWS.

The application is designed to run on Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This allows the application to be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and to recover from failures automatically.

## Features

- **Containerization with Docker**: The application is packaged into a Docker container, ensuring consistency across multiple development and production environments.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins**: Changes to the application are automatically built, tested, and deployed, ensuring that the application is always in a releasable state.
- **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**: The cloud infrastructure is defined and managed as code, allowing for versioning, reuse, and automation.
- **Scalability and High Availability with Kubernetes**: The application can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and can recover from failures automatically.
