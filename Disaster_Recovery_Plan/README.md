## Project Overview

This project outlines the implementation of a disaster recovery plan using AWS services. It includes:

- DNS Failover using AWS Route 53 for high availability.
- Data Backups using AWS S3 for data resilience.
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CloudFormation for efficient recovery and replication.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured.
3. Python 3.x installed.
4. Boto3 library (`pip install boto3`).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone
   cd aws-disaster-recovery-plan
   pip install boto3

Configure your AWS CLI with the necessary IAM permissions to access AWS services.

Usage
DNS Failover with AWS Route 53:

Open the Python script configure_dns_failover.py.
Update the script's variables to match your DNS failover configuration.
Run the script to set up DNS failover.
Data Backups with AWS S3:

Open the Python script configure_data_backups.py.
Update the script's variables to specify your data backup settings.
Run the script to configure data backups using Amazon S3.
Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation:

Create a CloudFormation template (e.g., disaster-recovery-template.yaml) to define your infrastructure as code.
Customize the template to include the necessary resources, VPCs, security groups, and other components for your primary and secondary environments.
Customization
Extend and customize the disaster recovery plan to match your specific infrastructure, business requirements, and industry regulations.

Testing and Documentation
Conduct periodic disaster recovery drills to ensure the effectiveness of the plan.
Create runbooks detailing how to initiate failover, recover data, and deploy infrastructure using CloudFormation.
Monitoring and Alerting
Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health of your resources and health checks.
Configure S3 event notifications to alert you of changes in the backup and replication processes.
Team Training
Conduct training sessions for your team members on the recovery procedures and the use of AWS services.
Run periodic drills to keep your team members informed and ready to respond in case of a disaster.
Compliance and Legal Considerations
Ensure that your disaster recovery plan complies with legal and regulatory requirements relevant to your industry.

Periodic Reviews and Updates
Regularly review and update your disaster recovery plan to account for changes in your infrastructure, business needs, and AWS services.
