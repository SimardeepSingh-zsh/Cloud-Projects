# Advanced Dockerized Web Application Deployment with Kubernetes and Terraform

This project demonstrates the deployment of an advanced web application using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. The project includes a Dockerfile for containerization, a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for orchestrating the application, Terraform scripts for provisioning infrastructure, and an advanced Python web application using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your development machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Your Docker Hub username and repository for container images.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Dockerfile**: Contains the instructions to build the Docker image for the web application.

2. **webapp-deployment.yaml**: Kubernetes Deployment manifest for managing the web application.

3. **terraform/main.tf**: Terraform script for provisioning infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, Load Balancer).

4. **main.py**: An advanced Python web application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the advanced web application:

1. Build and push the Docker image to your Docker Hub repository:

   docker build -t your-docker-hub-username/webapp:latest .
   docker push your-docker-hub-username/webapp:latest
   
Apply the Kubernetes Deployment:

kubectl apply -f webapp-deployment.yaml
Use Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure:

cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply
Access the deployed web application using the Load Balancer IP or domain.

Customization
Dockerfile: Modify the Dockerfile to include additional dependencies and configurations required by your application.

webapp-deployment.yaml: Adjust the deployment configuration in the YAML file as per your application's resource requirements.

main.py: Customize the Python web application logic, routes, and database model according to your application's functionality.

Cleanup
To remove the deployed resources, run the following commands:

Delete the Kubernetes Deployment:

kubectl delete -f webapp-deployment.yaml
Destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure:

cd terraform/
terraform destroy
