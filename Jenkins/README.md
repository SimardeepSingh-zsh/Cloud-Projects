# Automated Security Scanning in Jenkins Pipeline

![Jenkins Logo](https://jenkins.io/images/logos/jenkins-logo.png)

This project demonstrates how to integrate automated security scanning into your Jenkins pipeline using tools like OWASP ZAP and Anchore for container scanning. By incorporating security checks into the pipeline, you can identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- **Jenkins**: Ensure Jenkins is up and running in your environment.

- **Docker**: Install Docker to enable containerization and scanning with Anchore.

- **OWASP ZAP**: Set up OWASP ZAP for web application security testing.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to integrate automated security scanning into your Jenkins pipeline:

1. **Jenkins Configuration**:

   - Ensure Jenkins is installed and properly configured in your environment.

   - Install the necessary plugins (Pipeline, Docker, etc.).

2. **Setup OWASP ZAP**:

   - Configure OWASP ZAP for automated security testing.

   - Define your security scan settings and policies.

3. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline**:

   - Define a Jenkins pipeline using the `Jenkinsfile` in this project.

   - Customize the pipeline according to your specific application and security scanning requirements.

4. **Docker Containerization**:

   - Create a Dockerfile for your application to containerize it.

   - Use Docker to build and push the container image to a container registry.

5. **Security Scan Script**:

   - Modify the `security_scan.sh` script in the `scripts` directory to include security scanning with OWASP ZAP and Anchore.

6. **Pipeline Execution**:

   - Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to build, scan, and test your application.

   - Security scanning results should be accessible within your Jenkins pipeline reports.

7. **Monitoring and Notifications**:

   - Set up monitoring and notifications to alert your team of any security findings.

8. **Documentation**:

   - Document your security scanning process and pipeline configuration for future reference.

## Conclusion

By integrating automated security scanning into your Jenkins pipeline, you can identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, improving the overall security of your applications. This project provides a starting point for your implementation.

Feel free to customize and expand this README.md to fit your specific environment and tools. Additionally, remember to maintain regular updates and reviews of your security scanning process to adapt to evolving security threats.
