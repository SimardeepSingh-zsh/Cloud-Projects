# Centralized Logging Solution using AWS

This project demonstrates how to set up a centralized logging solution using AWS services, including AWS CloudWatch Logs for log shipping and AWS Elasticsearch Service for log analysis.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

- Logging logs from various resources using AWS CloudWatch Logs.
- Storing and analyzing logs centrally with AWS Elasticsearch Service.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured.
3. Python 3.x installed.
4. Boto3 library (`pip install boto3`).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone 
   cd aws-centralized-logging
Install the required Python libraries:

pip install boto3
Configure your AWS CLI with the necessary IAM permissions to access AWS services.

Usage
Log Shipping with AWS CloudWatch Logs:

Open the Python script log_shipper.py.
Update the script's variables to match your log shipping configuration.
Run the script to start shipping logs to CloudWatch Logs.
Log Analysis with AWS Elasticsearch Service:

Create an AWS Elasticsearch cluster using the provided CloudFormation template elasticsearch-template.yaml.
Customize the template to match your Elasticsearch cluster requirements.
Deploy the template using the AWS CloudFormation console or AWS CLI.
Customization
Extend and customize the centralized logging solution to meet your specific infrastructure and business requirements.

Testing and Documentation
Test your centralized logging setup with different types of logs.
Create documentation for log analysis procedures and best practices.
Monitoring and Alerting
Set up monitoring and alerting for your Elasticsearch cluster to proactively detect issues and potential security threats.

Team Training
Conduct training sessions for your team members on log shipping and log analysis procedures.

Compliance and Legal Considerations
Ensure that your centralized logging setup complies with legal and regulatory requirements relevant to your industry.

Periodic Reviews and Updates
Regularly review and update your centralized logging solution to account for changes in your infrastructure, business needs, and AWS services.
